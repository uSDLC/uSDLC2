	Before <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> can help us with the design we need to have a high level concept on how our project will look. Without this our design process lacks direction. There is a process of consideration of different options and decisions that need to be made first. If we document the process here they provide a starting point for the design and a perspective on the decisions made for a clearer understanding of the project.</p>

	<span>Reason<span style="font-size:14px;"> - notes of why this project is needed</span></span></h2>
<p>
	Through my career I have worked in most positions within a software development project. As a software manager I was particularly incensed by the lack of connectivity between the different processes that make up a life-cycle. Examples presented to the analysts does not get recorded for development or testing. The 'why' of a process or approach is not communicated to teams downstream of the analysts and architects. Testers and document writers often have to independly learn how an application operates before they can do their jobs - often making inaccurate assumptions. Support rarely get enough information to reliably keep the system updated. Lastly once a project is done the information needed for the next phase is often lost or out of date - making a complete rewrite more likely than upgrading the current system.</p>

	Investigation<span style="font-size: 14px; ">&nbsp;- the path to a decision</span></h2>
<p>
	I have spent the last two years creating a proof-of-concept. It is available on <a href="https://github.com/usdlc/usdlc" id="s10a9">GitHub</a>. During that time it has collected a lot of cruft as I researched avenues and technologies that proved not to be on the main path. I also decided on supporting frameworks that are either less suitable than I hoped or have been surpassed by others. The product is complete except for some really detailed documentation. I could not use uSDLC to develop uSDLC, but I can use it for uSDLC2.</p>
</div><div id="s5" class="editable section"><h2>
	<span>Result<span style="font-size:14px;"> - a high level description of what the finished project will look like</span></span></h2>
<p>
	That's easy. Look at <a href="http://usdlc.net" id="s5a9">http://usdlc.net</a>. <em><strong>uSDLC2</strong></em> will have similar functionality but with a cleaner interface and running on a smaller more responsive framework.</p>
</div><div id="s6" class="editable section"><h2>
	<span>User Interface<span style="font-size:14px;"> - technology, look and feel, user experience</span></span></h2>
<p>
	<em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>&nbsp;uses a single page browser based UI. Content is loaded on demand to provide a responsive flexible interface.</p>
</div><div id="s7" class="editable section"><h2>
	<span>Language<span style="font-size:14px;"> - computer languages and libraries decided upon</span></span></h2>
<p>
	<em><strong>uSDLC2</strong></em> relies on coffee-script for both client and server core code. With the advent of V8, the Google Javascript engine, Javascript now has mainstream performance. I find coffee-script the cleanest of the modern interpreted languages.</p>
</div><div id="s8" class="editable section"><h2>
	<span>Frameworks<span style="font-size:14px;"> - hardware and software frameworks anticipated</span></span></h2>
<p>
	On the server side, <a href="http://nodejs.org/" id="s8a9"><strong>Node.js</strong></a> has progressed in leaps and bounds. With coffee-script to write in I now consider it an excellent platform. In <em><strong>uSDLC2</strong>&nbsp;</em>the server will be more light-weight - primarily serving files and acting as an instrumentation bridge to production code.</p>
<p>
	The client requirse a HTML-5 browser such as <a href="http://www.chromium.org/Home" id="s8a10"><strong>Chrome</strong></a> to leverage the modern open source packages and to provide client side persistence.</p>
<p>
	HTML wysisyg editing uses <a href="http://aloha-editor.org/" id="s8a11"><strong>Aloha</strong></a> for a more integrated and customisable solution.</p>

	<span>Deployment<span style="font-size:14px;"> - envisioned deployment environment</span></span></h2>
<p>
	One other benefit of node.js is that it is a single executable or around 10Mb for each environment. The online installer can be a archive with the node.js binary for the target environment and a simple Javascript installation script. <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em>, once running, has a utility to bundle up an existing installation for off-line clones.</p>
