<h1><a>Documents</a></h1>

<p>uSDLC saves all documents as standard HTML files.</p>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="documents"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'documents.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/documents.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">documents.coffee</a></span><span class="ckeditor"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'ckeditor.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/ckeditor.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">ckeditor.coffee</a></span><span class="windows"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'windows.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/windows.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">windows.coffee</a></span><span class="projects"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'projects.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/projects.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">projects.coffee</a></span></div>

<h2>Editing</h2>

<p>uSDLC uses <a href="http://ckeditor.com/">CKEditor</a> for documents, dividing up the provided functionality into tabs. All the standard WYSIWYG&nbsp;features are provided, along with uSDLC specific ones in the last tab. In short a uSDLC document is a HTML file that can be clearly displayed in a browser without running the application. Editors can manipulate data inserted or maintained by uSDLC as they can any other document element.</p>

<h3>Creating links between documents</h3>

<p>CKEditor provides a general <a>link</a> for in the Insert tab. By choosing &#39;other&#39; for the link type you can use this to reference local documents by name. It is easier to use the Link action provided by uSDLC - on the uSDLC tab, the context menu or by typing alt-L. Highlight some text first then use the above methods to create a link. The document will have the same name as the link text - with spaces and other non-word characters converted to underscores. If the document exists it is opened, otherwise a new document is <a>created</a>.</p>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="document_link"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'document_link.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/document_link.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">document_link.coffee</a></span></div>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<h3>The Address Bar</h3>

<p>The address bar can be used for all the navigation elements - Project, Document and Section.</p>

<div style="background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px 10px;">http://localhost:9009/uSDLC2/Documents?edit#Navigation</div>

<p>This example assumes a <a href="Installation">standard local install</a> of uSDLC2. It will open a page on uSDLC2.&nbsp;Each project is referenced by name as uSDLC2 can convert this to a path to the project. The HTML document comes next. If the document doesn&#39;t exist, it is created when it is given content.</p>

<p>Each project remembers the last Document and Section displayed - and will return there on a reload if they are not on the command-line.</p>

<div style="background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px 10px;">http://localhost:9009/uSDLC2?edit</div>

<p>Normally you will only need to bookmark to the project level - which will return you to where you last left off.</p>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="app"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'app.coffee',path:'app.coffee',category:'.'})">app.coffee</a></span></div>

<h3>Between Projects</h3>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="projects"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'projects.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/projects.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">projects.coffee</a></span></div>

<h3>Between Documents</h3>

<p>The document to edit can be selected from a link by shift-clicking. The Index page will typically have links to everything (if you put them there).</p>

<p>The second drop-down on the uSDLC tab can be used to select the current document in the current project.</p>

<p>When changing projects the last document editing on this browser by this user will be loaded.</p>

<p>The address line can have the document added after the project - as above. Note that spaces are represented by underscores.</p>

<p>Finally links can be created anywhere that reference other document.</p>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="documents"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'documents.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/documents.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">documents.coffee</a></span></div>

<h3>Within a Document</h3>

<h2>Windows</h2>

<p>uSDLC needs to open windows for other components. Like any windowing system, selecting a window will bring it to the front.</p>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="ckeditor"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'ckeditor.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/ckeditor.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">ckeditor.coffee</a></span><span class="documents"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'documents.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/documents.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">documents.coffee</a></span><span class="bridge"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'bridge.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/bridge.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">bridge.coffee</a></span></div>

<h2>Saving Documents</h2>

<p>uSDLC automatically saves a document in pauses in typing or change of focus between windows. A <em>Saved</em>&nbsp;message will display to the right of the editor tabs.</p>

<p>A save operation includes merging of other data windows into the main document then creating a difference document between the expected document on disk and the changes. If the document on disk has been changed by some external method (such as a version control update) then it will not be possible to save the document without merging the changes.</p>
