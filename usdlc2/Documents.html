<h1>Documents</h1>

<p>uSDLC saves all documents as standard HTML files.</p>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="documents"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'documents.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/documents.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">documents.coffee</a></span></div>

<h2>Editing</h2>

<p>uSDLC uses <a href="http://ckeditor.com/">CKEditor</a> for documents, dividing up the provided functionality into tabs. All the standard WYSIWYG&nbsp;features are provided, along with uSDLC specific ones in the last tab. In short a uSDLC document is a HTML file that can be clearly displayed in a browser without running the application. Editors can manipulate data inserted or maintained by uSDLC as they can any other document element.</p>

<h3>Key Mapping</h3>

<p>CodeMirror provides key maps for Emacs, Vi and CodeMirror modes - where the latter is similar to TextMate. Insert mode while using the Vi map is identical to the TextMate mode, providing the best of both approaches.</p>

<p>Remembering key bindings is always difficult. To aid in this the uSDLC context menu displays the key mapping against the operation - when you hover over the entry of interest.</p>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="codemirror"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'codemirror.coffee',path:'client/codemirror/codemirror.coffee',category:'codemirror'})">codemirror.coffee</a></span></div>

<h3>The Context Menu</h3>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="menu"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'menu.html',path:'client/codemirror/menu.html',category:'codemirror'})">menu.html</a></span></div>

<h2>Navigation</h2>

<h3>The Address Bar</h3>

<p>The address bar can be used for all the navigation elements - Project, Document and Section.</p>

<div style="background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px 10px;">http://localhost:9009/uSDLC2/Documents?edit#Navigation</div>

<p>This example assumes a <a href="Installation">standard local install</a> of uSDLC2. It will open a page on uSDLC2.&nbsp;Each project is referenced by name as uSDLC2 can convert this to a path to the project. The HTML document comes next. If the document doesn&#39;t exist, it is created when it is given content.</p>

<p>Each project remembers the last Document and Section displayed - and will return there on a reload if they are not on the command-line.</p>

<div style="background:#eee;border:1px solid #ccc;padding:5px 10px;">http://localhost:9009/uSDLC2?edit</div>

<p>Normally you will only need to bookmark to the project level - which will return you to where you last left off.</p>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="app"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'app.coffee',path:'app.coffee',category:'.'})">app.coffee</a></span></div>

<h3>Between Projects</h3>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="projects"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'projects.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/projects.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">projects.coffee</a></span></div>

<h3>Between Documents</h3>

<p>The document to edit can be selected from a link by shift-clicking. The Index page will typically have links to everything (if you put them there).</p>

<p>The second drop-down on the uSDLC tab can be used to select the current document in the current project.</p>

<p>When changing projects the last document editing on this browser by this user will be loaded.</p>

<p>The address line can have the document added after the project - as above. Note that spaces are represented by underscores.</p>

<div class="metadata Ref">Ref: <span class="documents"><a href="javascript:usdlc.edit_source({value:'documents.coffee',path:'client/ckeditor/documents.coffee',category:'ckeditor'})">documents.coffee</a></span></div>
