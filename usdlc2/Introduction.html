<h1>Introduction&nbsp;<span style="font-size:14px;"><b>(<a href="http://www.screencast.com/t/yxGLLwZ0O2">screencast</a>)</b></span></h1>

<p><em><strong>uSDLC2</strong></em>&nbsp;generates a set of html documents in the <em>usdlc2/</em> directory of your project. These can be reviewed in a browser without additional software - and contain all documentation and instrumentation details and code.</p>

<p><strong><em>uSDLC2</em></strong> uses the open source <a href="http://ckeditor.com/">CKEditor</a>&nbsp;for simple WYSIWYG&nbsp;editing and <a href="http://codemirror.net/">CodeMirror</a>&nbsp;for source code and data editing.</p>

<h2>First Page Load</h2>

<p>After a first install, <strong><em>uSDLC2</em></strong>&nbsp;will be the current project, with <em>Index</em> as the current document. Whenever the page is reloaded, the current project, document and page location are restored.</p>

<p>The tabs along the top break down editing functionality. All tabs but the last are core WYSIWYG editor functions.</p>

<h2>The <em><strong>uSDLC</strong></em> Tab</h2>

<p>The left box displays the current project. Select it to change project or add a new one. When switching projects the last document and location are restored.</p>

<p>The second box displays the current document. Switch documents here. New documents are created from hyperlinks and will display in the list. You can also switch to the new document from the hyperlink by holding shift down when selecting it.</p>

<p>The next button displays a structured table of contents for the current document.</p>

<p>The button bar to the right implement <em><strong>uSDLC2</strong></em> specific functionality. Hover over each button to see it's function and short-cut key.</p>

<h3>Hyperlinks</h3>

<p>Highlight any phrase and click the link button to create a link to a new or existing document. More general hyperlinks can be created from the <em>Insert</em> tab. Once a link is created it can be modified by double-clicking or followed by shift-clicking.</p>

<h3>Instrumentation</h3>

<p>The target us used to add instrumentation instructions, code or data to the document. Anything added here can be accessed and used to connection to the production system or parts thereof.</p>

<h3>Bridges</h3>

<p>Instrumentation is a visible instruction to exercise the production system. The bridge code takes this instrumentation and makes it happen.</p>

<h3>The Bookshelf</h3>

<p>The bookshelf is a way to access all the files in the project.</p>

<h3>Play</h3>

<p>Once instrumentation and bridging are complete, press the play button to instrument the current and all inner sections.</p>

<h3>A Terminal</h3>

<p>This is a standard terminal to the server containing the project. All non-UI shell commands are available.</p>
