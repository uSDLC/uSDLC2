<h1 style="">Metadata</h1>

<p>Every section can have different forms of metadata attached. Like footnotes they are visible at the end of the section with distinct formatting. Like any other element they are available for editing. Typically they are created as a byproduct of another operation.</p>

<h2>References</h2>

<p>Reference metadata is a list of links to information of interest in the current section.</p>

<h3>Source Editing</h3>

<p>If you choose to edit any production source files from a section a link is kept so that they are easier to find next time.</p>

<h3>Bridge</h3>

<p>When a Given/When/Then (GWT) element is created in a section a link&nbsp;is created to the instrumentation code contained within the document.</p>

<h3>Play GWT</h3>

<p>When a Given/When/Then (GWT) element is created in a section a link&nbsp;is created to execute (play) the instrumentation code connecting the documentation to the production code.</p>

<h3>Other Pages and Sections</h3>

<p>The editor context menu allows links to other pages or sections to be added for cross-referencing.</p>
